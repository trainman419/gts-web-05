# We use this because we don't want to store our databases in the

# Another common use of the .gitignore file is to store configuration files.
# We don't need to worry about this right now.

# Your system also has a global .gitignore file which will allow you to ignore
# files that are created automatically by your operating system or other 
# applications, for example .DS_Store in OSX.
